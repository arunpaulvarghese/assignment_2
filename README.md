Description about the arun_model_v1 file

The program focuses on data analysis and classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a breast cancer dataset. Initially, the dataset is loaded from a CSV file and cleaned by removing unnecessary columns and converting categorical values in the diagnosis column to binary. The dataset is then split into feature variables (X) and the target variable (y), followed by a division into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio. The class distribution in the training set is examined to understand the balance of the dataset. After preprocessing, the SVM with a linear kernel is trained using the training data.

Following the model training, predictions are made on both the training and testing sets. The performance of the model is evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and F1-scores for both classes (malignant and benign). The results indicate a high level of accuracy and strong F1-scores, suggesting that the model performs well in classifying the data. The detailed metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness, with high accuracy and balanced precision and recall, indicating a robust classification capability for identifying breast cancer based on the given features.

Descripion about the second model which is arun_model_v2

The model's accuracy and effectiveness are measured using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and F1-scores for both classes (malignant and benign). The results reveal a perfect accuracy score and F1-scores on the training data, indicating that the model has learned the training data very well. However, the testing data shows a slightly lower accuracy with some misclassifications, yet it still achieves high F1-scores, demonstrating the model's strong capability in generalizing to unseen data. These metrics suggest that the Decision Tree classifier performs effectively in classifying breast cancer, making it a valuable tool for medical diagnosis.
